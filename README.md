          <p> Gender equality means that the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of individuals will not depend on whether they are male or female, handicapped or able-bodied, young or elderly, white or black, or from rural or urban settings. Women are entitled to live in dignity, safety, and security. </p>
            <p> Gender equality means that men and women have equal power and equal opportunities for financial independence, education, and personal development. </p>
            <p> Gender equality can refer to equal opportunities or formal equality based on gender or refer to equal representation or equality of outcomes for gender, also called substantive equality. </p>
            <p> Gender equity is the process of being fair to women and men. To ensure fairness, strategies, and measures must often be available to compensate for womenâ€™s historical and social disadvantages that prevent women and men from otherwise operating on a level playing field. Equity leads to equality.
              Gender equality requires equal enjoyment by women and men of socially valued goods, opportunities, resources, and rewards. </p>
